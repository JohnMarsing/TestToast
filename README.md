# TestToast



I followed the [instruction](https://github.com/Blazored/Toast) but am getting this error.

> InvalidOperationException: Cannot provide a value for property 'ToastService' on type 'Blazored.Toast.BlazoredToasts'. There is no registered service of type 'Blazored.Toast.Services.IToastService'.

I can get this to work for a Blazor 8 Standalone Web App, but not for a Hosted app
